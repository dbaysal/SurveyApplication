# Survey Apllication
This project was developed as the final project for Turkcell .NET Bootcamp. The application aims to provide a platform for creating and posting surveys, as well as enabling users to participate in surveys by submitting their answers. Additionally, the application offers functionality to display survey statistics, allowing users to gain insights from the collected data.

# Application Structure
The application consists of two main components: an API project responsible for handling backend CRUD operations, and an MVC project that serves as an interface for users to answer surveys and view statistics. Currently, there is no user interface implemented for creating surveys directly within the application. However, surveys can still be created manually by accessing the relevant endpoint using Swagger or similar tools. This allows users to interact with the API and create surveys programmatically.
